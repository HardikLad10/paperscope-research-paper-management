## Project Summary

The Internal Paper Review System aims to simplify the process of reviewing unpublished research papers within an organization. Authors can easily upload their papers/manuscripts to receive organized feedback from a team of peers, allowing for early evaluation before sending their work out for external review.

By keeping all submissions and reviews in one platform, the system promotes constructive criticism, knowledge sharing, and overall improvement in quality. Multiple reviewers can provide input on each paper, ensuring a variety of perspectives and a comprehensive assessment. This collaborative approach ultimately enhances the standard of research produced.
