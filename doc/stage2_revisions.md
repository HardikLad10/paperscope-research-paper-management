We've made a few changes to resolve the following comments from stage 2.

1. -1 for missing relationships on an ER diagram.see [revised_ER_diagram.pdf](revised_3NF_relational.md)
2. -12 Cannot find relational schema and normalization process. see [revised_3NF_relational.md](revised_3NF_relational.md) which contains the normalization process and the relational schema. ER README.md remains unchanged.
