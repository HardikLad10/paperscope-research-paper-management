## 📋 Resume Bullet Points (ATS-Optimized)

### For Software Engineer / Full-Stack Developer

• Engineered a full-stack research paper management system using Node.js, Express, React, and MySQL, implementing **25+ RESTful API endpoints** with comprehensive CRUD operations, batch processing, and AI-powered recommendations

• Designed and implemented **4 ACID-compliant database transactions** including an advanced batch creation system using `SELECT FOR UPDATE` row-level locking, composite subqueries, and GROUP BY aggregations, ensuring atomic operations across multiple tables

• Integrated **Google Gemini 2.5 Flash LLM** via GCP Generative AI API to provide intelligent paper recommendations, processing up to 100 papers simultaneously for semantic similarity analysis with 5-10 contextual recommendations per query

• Developed **4 stored procedures and 3 database triggers** enforcing business logic at the database layer, including author analytics, safe deletion workflows, and AI draft validation, reducing application-level bugs by enforcing constraints server-side

• Optimized database performance through strategic indexing (10+ indexes), connection pooling (10 concurrent connections), and FULLTEXT search capabilities, enabling efficient querying of large datasets with pagination support

• Implemented comprehensive data integrity mechanisms including **5 CHECK constraints**, foreign key relationships with CASCADE policies, and trigger-based validation, ensuring consistent data quality across all application layers

• Deployed production-ready application on **Google Cloud Platform (Cloud SQL) and Vercel serverless functions**, configuring SSL/TLS encryption, OAuth authentication, and environment-based configuration management

---

### For Database Engineer / Backend Developer

• Architected normalized database schema with **8 tables, 15+ foreign key relationships**, and self-referential structures, implementing 3NF normalization and comprehensive indexing strategies for optimal query performance

• Engineered advanced SQL features including stored procedures with control structures, BEFORE UPDATE triggers with conditional logic, CHECK constraints for domain validation, and transactions with READ COMMITTED isolation level

• Implemented sophisticated batch transaction processing using `SELECT FOR UPDATE` for pessimistic locking, composite IN subqueries for duplicate detection, and GROUP BY aggregations for summary statistics, ensuring ACID compliance in concurrent environments

• Developed complex analytical queries using JOINs, subqueries, GROUP BY, and aggregate functions (COUNT, MAX, COALESCE) to generate author insights, portfolio summaries, and publication statistics across multiple dimensions

• Designed data validation architecture with database-level triggers preventing invalid state transitions (e.g., AI drafts requiring PDF URLs before promotion), CHECK constraints enforcing business rules, and foreign key cascades maintaining referential integrity

---

### For AI/ML Engineer / Data Scientist

• Integrated **Google Gemini 2.5 Flash LLM** for semantic paper recommendation, implementing OAuth authentication, prompt engineering for structured JSON outputs, and temperature-controlled generation (0.2-0.7) balancing creativity with accuracy

• Developed AI-powered workflow enabling users to generate draft papers from LLM recommendations, with database-enforced validation ensuring quality before status promotion, demonstrating end-to-end AI integration in production systems

• Implemented semantic similarity analysis comparing research papers across multiple dimensions (topic, methodology, abstract content, keywords), processing batches of 100 papers to identify the 10 most similar papers with contextual relevance scoring

---

## 🎯 Condensed Version (1-2 Bullets)

### Option 1 (Full-Stack Focus)
